### Welcome ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Computer Science student from Germany. In addition to being a student, I also currently work as a Full-Stack Web Developer.

I have experience working with Flutter/Dart, Python, Java, Docker, Shell-Scripting, HTML/CSS, Kotlin and Rust.
I'm constantly trying out new technologies and learning new skills.
